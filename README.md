## Creating SUMO simulation scenarios with real-world traffic volume data

This project provides tools to create SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) traffic scenarios using real-world traffic volume data. It processes traffic count data and generates SUMO-compatible simulation files. This is a project associated with ICCPS 2025 Poster submission. We will update the bibtex citation once the paper is published.

* the two .net.xml files are identical except that preloaded signal type is NEMA for SR1-3-NEMA.net.xml.

## Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Conversion**: `csv_to_volume_xml.py` processes the raw data and generates SUMO volume and trips files. Use command line arguments to run the script:

Input:
```bash
python csv_to_volume_xml.py \
  --csv_input data/sampled_intersections_volume_2022-2025.csv \ # TMC csv file
  --route_file SUMO_files/SR1-3.rou.xml \ # SUMO input route file
  --output SUMO_files/SR1-3_volume.xml \ # SUMO output volume file
  --start "2024-01-01 00:00:00-05:00" \ # Start date and time
  --end "2024-01-01 23:59:59-05:00" \ # End date and time
```
*Note: We recommend the time period to be less than 1 week in each scenario. The processing time and simulation speed will be affected as the time period increases.*

Output:
```bash
SUMO_files/SR1-3_volume.xml # SUMO volume file
SUMO_files/SR1-3_volume_trips.xml # SUMO trips file
```
Besides, following configuration files are updated with the new volume and trips data:
```bash
SUMO_files/SR1-3.sumocfg  # actuated signal configuration
SUMO_files/SR1-3-NEMA.sumocfg  # NEMA-standard signal configuration
```

2. **Route Sampling**: The script automatically calls `routeSampler.py` to generate realistic vehicle trips based on the volume data. The route sampler:
- Matches traffic counts from real data
- Preserves turn ratios at intersections
- Generates time-distributed vehicle trips

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+ (tested in Python 3.12.4)
- SUMO 1.20.0
- Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Simulation

1. Process the volume data:
```bash
python csv_to_volume_xml.py [arguments]
```

2. Run SUMO with either actuated or NEMA configuration:
```bash
# actuated configuration
sumo-gui -c SUMO_files/SR1-3.sumocfg

# NEMA-standard configuration
sumo-gui -c SUMO_files/SR1-3-NEMA.sumocfg
```

## Configuration

The simulation can be configured through either `SR1-3.sumocfg` or `SR1-3-NEMA.sumocfg` (for NEMA-standard signal control), which specify:

### Input Files
- `SR1-3.net.xml` or `SR1-3-NEMA.net.xml`: Road network definition
- `SR1-3_volume_trips.xml`: Generated vehicle trips based on volume data. This is automatically updated by `csv_to_volume_xml.py` after new trips file is generated.
- `SR1-3_timing.add.xml`: Traffic signal timing plans

### Output Files
- `SR1-3-output-stats.xml` or `SR1-3-NEMA-output-stats.xml`: Traffic performance metrics including:
  - Vehicle counts
  - Average speed
  - Wait time and travel time
  - Departure delay
